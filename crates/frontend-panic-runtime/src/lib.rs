//! The two things `std` would otherwise supply to a final binary: a `#[panic_handler]` and the
//! `eh_personality` lang item.
//!
//! # Why this is a crate of its own
//!
//! It was half of `frontend::unwind_janky` until 2026-09-08, and that pairing made the whole test
//! suite of every dependent unbuildable. `unwind_janky` is a *library* - `rustc_span` and
//! `rustc_proc_macro` both depend on it for `catch`. A test target links `test`, which
//! links `std`, which defines `panic_impl` and `eh_personality`; a library that also defines them
//! is a duplicate lang item and nothing in the package compiles:
//!
//! ```text
//! error[E0152]: duplicate lang item in crate `std` (which `test` depends on): `panic_impl`
//!   = note: the lang item is first defined in crate `unwind_janky`
//! ```
//!
//! A lang item may be defined once per linked binary, so it belongs to the binary. The split is
//! that rule written down: `unwind_janky` declares the runtime symbols it calls and defines no
//! lang item, so any dependent may link `std` beside it, and this crate defines the lang items
//! and is named by the final binary alone.
//!
//! **Being a dependency is not enough to break a test build; being *named* is.** rustc loads a
//! crate when something refers to it, and registers lang items from the crates it loaded. So
//! this crate may sit in a library's `[dependencies]` while only that package's binary target
//! says `extern crate frontend_panic_runtime;`, and the library and test targets never load it.
//! Measured, not assumed: a `no_std` lib with an unnamed dependency defining `panic_impl` builds
//! its test target cleanly, and adding `extern crate` to that lib produces the E0152 above.
//!
//! # What is here
//!
//! `#[panic_handler]`, which formats the message and hands it to `__rust_start_panic`; the
//! `eh_personality` lang item in [`personality`]; the two `#[rustc_std_internal_symbol]` stubs
//! `panic_unwind` calls back into; and the `extern crate` lines for `panic_unwind` and `unwind`
//! that put the panic runtime and the libSystem unwinder in the binary.
//!
//! `catch` and `resume` are not here. They are the API, they define no lang item, and they stay
//! in `crates/unwind-janky`, whose header carries the argument for why any of this exists.
